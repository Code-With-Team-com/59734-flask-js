# What To Do – Quick Start

## 1) Say hi in Chat 👋
- Open Chat and greet your team.
- Share your availability and time zone to help scheduling.

## 2) Propose a meeting 🗓️
- In Chat, propose a meeting time that works for you.
- Why: align on scope, next steps, and responsibilities.
- Everyone needs to accept for it to be scheduled.

Constraints:
- You have 48 hours to book the meeting.
- The meeting time must be within the next 7 days.

## 3) Join the call ▶️
- After everyone accepts, the “Team call” button shows the scheduled time.
- The join link appears on that button 5 minutes before the meeting.
- The call is on Microsoft Teams; no login required.

## 4) Create tasks 📝
After the kickoff:
1. Open the repository’s GitHub Projects board.
2. Break down work from README.md into small, clear tasks.
3. Create issues, add labels/assignees, and set priorities.
4. Keep the board updated (To Do → In Progress → Done).

## 5) Develop the project 🛠️
- Implement the agreed tasks from the board.
- Communicate blockers early in Chat.
- Keep issues and statuses updated as you progress.

When you’re done:
- Your team presses the “Finish” button.
- When everyone has pressed it, the project enters Review mode.
- A project mentor reviews the work and provides feedback.
- Your team decides whether to continue iterating or wrap it up.
